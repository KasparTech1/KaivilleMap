# Plans Directory

Generated implementation plans will be saved here.

These files ARE committed to the repository to share architectural decisions with the team.

Example plan file:
- PLAN-research-center.md

Plans are generated based on your decision answers and include:
- Architecture decisions summary
- Implementation roadmap
- Technical requirements
- Testing strategy
- Risk mitigation
- Next steps

To generate a plan, ask Claude Code:
"Generate an implementation plan from my decisions and save it to
maintenance-room/plans/PLAN-research-center.md"
